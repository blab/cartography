\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{
  {\bf Distances between clusters identified per pathogen dataset and method compared to known genetic groups.}
  Distances are measured by normalized variation of information (VI).
  Smaller VI values indicate fewer differences between HDBSCAN clusters and known genetic groups.
  VI of 0 indicates identical clusters and 1 indicates maximally different clusters.
  Known genetic groups include Nextstrain clades, reassortment groups identified by TreeKnit as Maximally Compatible Clades (MCC), and Pango lineages.
  Total clusters refers to the number of clusters identified for a given dataset and method not including the ``-1'' label that HDBSCAN assigns to records that could not be assigned to a cluster.
  Threshold refers to the minimum distance between initial clusters for HDBSCAN to consider them as distinct clusters.
  For embedding methods, the threshold represents the Euclidean distance between sequences in each embedding.
  For the genetic distance method, the threshold represents the number of nucleotide differences between sequences.
  We identified optimal thresholds per pathogen, genetic group, and method from early influenza and SARS-CoV-2 data and applied these optimal thresholds to the corresponding late datasets for each pathogen.
  Datasets and methods without a threshold value in this table used the threshold from their corresponding early datasets.
  Rows appear in ascending order of VI values per method within each combination of pathogen and genetic group type.}\label{S_Table_optimal_cluster_parameters}

\end{table}

\begin{table}
\caption{{\bf Number of clusters (\emph{n\_clusters}) identified by HDBSCAN, transitions between clusters in the phylogeny, and excess transitions indicating non-monophyletic groups per pathogen dataset and embedding method.}
  This table reports the list of specific clusters per dataset and method (\emph{clusters}), the number of transitions between different cluster labels on the phylogeny (\emph{n\_cluster\_transitions}), and the list of observed transitions for pairs of clusters (\emph{transitions}).
  The number of excess transitions between clusters (\emph{n\_extra\_transitions}) reflects the number of times that we observed a transition from one source cluster to another beyond the one expected transition.
  Embeddings without any excess transitions reflect monophyletic groups in the corresponding pathogen phylogeny.
  Data available at \url{https://zenodo.org/records/13864652/files/S2_Table.csv}.}\label{S_Table_monophyletic_clusters}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\caption{{\bf Mutations observed per embedding cluster or Nextstrain clade relative to a reference genome sequence for each pathogen.}
Each row reflects the alternate allele identified at a specific position of a given pathogen genome or gene sequence, the pathogen dataset, the genetic group (an embedding cluster or Nextstrain clade), the number of clusters in the genetic group with the observed mutation, and the list of distinct genetic group labels with the mutation.
Mutations must have occurred in at least 10 samples of the given dataset with an allele frequency of at least 50\% to be reported in the table.
Cluster- or clade-specific mutations appear in rows with a \emph{cluster\_count} value of 1.

\begin{table}
\caption{{\bf Average Euclidean distances between each known recombinant, $X$, and its parental lineages $A$ and $B$ per embedding method.}
Distances include average pairwise comparisons between $A$ and $B$ (\emph{distance\_A\_B}), $A$ and $X$ (\emph{distance\_A\_X}), and $B$ and $X$ (\emph{distance\_B\_X}).
Additional columns indicate whether each recombinant lineage maps closer to both parental lineages (or at least one) than those parents map to each other (\emph{X\_maps\_closer\_to\_both\_parentals} and \emph{X\_maps\_closer\_to\_any\_parental}, respectively).
Records with values of ``True'' in the column \emph{X\_maps\_closer\_to\_both\_parentals} represent the expected placement of the recombinant lineage between its two parental lineages.
