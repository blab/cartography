# Tree Linked Flu Chart with PCA, MDS, TSNE, and UMAP

## Description of the Problem 
<p> DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:

Nextstrain.com can only handle diseases that have clear phylogenies, or where the virusâ€™ ancestry is easy to track through time. However, multiple diseases, such as enterovirus, bacteria, and malaria, recombine and are therefore their phylogenies are usually split at the chromosomal level, making it hard to hypothesize the entire diseases ancestry and location throughout time. The project is to create an interactive tool that uses different embeddings of genetic sequence data via PCA, MDS, t-SNE and U-MAP to identify patterns and relationships that aren't seen in phylogenies due to this recombination issue. The overall goal would be to integrate this tool into Nextstrain in the future.

*Recombination: Recombination is a process usually during meiosis where pieces of DNA are broken and recombined into the chromosome to produce new combinations of alleles. This process creates genetic diversity in the DNA sequences of different organisms. </p>
